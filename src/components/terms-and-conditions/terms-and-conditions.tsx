              1.1. Your stay with us is not intended to confer exclusive
              possession on either the client or guest nor to create the
              relationship of landlord and tenant between Luxstay Ventures
              Limited and either the client or the guest. Neither the client nor
              the guest will be entitled to any tenancy, or any short assured or
              assured tenancy, or to any statutory protection under the Housing
              Act 1988, or to any other statutory security of tenure now or upon
              the determination of this agreement.

            <p>
              2.1. The managing agent permit the client to occupy the property,
              such occupation being by the guest personally only and to use the
              owners&quot; furniture and effects for the accommodation period.
              All visitors to the apartment are the responsibility of the guest.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.2. You must be 18 years or over when you book your
              accommodation. Your booking is made as a consumer and you
              acknowledge that no liability can be accepted for any losses
              suffered or incurred by you.
            </p>

              is stated different) on the start day of your booking and, unless
              otherwise agreed, you must leave by 11am on the last day. If you
              fail to arrive by midnight on the day of the start date and do not
              advise us of a late arrival we may treat the booking as being
              cancelled by you.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.5. If you want to increase your length of stay then we will do
              everything possible subject to availability of accommodation to
              find something suitable for you. It must be borne in mind that
              this may not always be possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.6. If the number of people permitted to occupy an apartment is
              exceeded (which would be in breach of Health and Safety
              Regulations) we reserve the right to move excess occupants and
              charge for additional apartments or require the excess occupants
              to vacate the property.

              you as soon as possible to explain what has happened and to inform
              you of the cancellation or the change. If possible we will offer
